Say my name, say my name 
When no one is around you, 

Say baby I love you 
If you ain't runnin' game 

Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady,

Ain't callin' me baby
Why the sudden change?

Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you,

Say baby I love you
If you ain't runnin' game

Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady,

Ain't callin' me baby
Better say my name

Any other day
I would call, you would say,

"Baby, how's your day?"
But today, it ain't the same

Every other word is "Uh huh", "Yeah, okay"
Could it be that you are at the crib with another lady

If you took it there
First of all let me say

I am not the one to sit around and be played
So prove yourself to me

I'm the girl that you claim
Why don't you say the things

That you said to me yesterday
